# Advanced Vulnerability Scanner Simulator

## Project Overview

This project presents an advanced vulnerability scanner simulator developed in Python. It is designed to emulate the core functionalities of commercial vulnerability assessment tools like SecurityScorecard and BitSight, providing a hands-on demonstration of how such systems identify and report security weaknesses in web applications and network infrastructure. The simulator incorporates various scanning modules, including those for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Broken Authentication, Insecure Deserialization (conceptual), Security Misconfiguration (conceptual), Open Port Scanning, and Missing Security Headers.

## Motivation and Relevance

My experience at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) involved working extensively with industry-leading security platforms such as SecurityScorecard, BitSight, Blackite, and ServiceNow. These tools provided invaluable insights into organizational security postures, risk management, and compliance. This project is a direct application of the knowledge gained from those experiences, aiming to replicate and understand the underlying mechanisms of vulnerability detection and reporting.

Specifically, this simulator draws inspiration from:

*   **SecurityScorecard & BitSight:** Their comprehensive approach to external security ratings, continuous monitoring, and identification of vulnerabilities across various risk factors (e.g., application security, network security, patching cadence).
*   **Blackite:** Its focus on attack surface management and threat intelligence, which informs the conceptual modules for security misconfiguration and insecure deserialization.
*   **ServiceNow:** The platform's role in IT Service Management (ITSM) and Security Operations (SecOps), particularly in automating vulnerability response and incident management workflows. While this simulator doesn't directly integrate with ServiceNow, the design principles consider how detected vulnerabilities would be triaged and managed in an enterprise environment.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of my understanding of cybersecurity principles, web application security, network scanning, and the operational aspects of vulnerability management, making it highly relevant for internship applications in cybersecurity roles at companies like Bank of America, Amazon, CrowdStrike, Accenture, and Scotiabank.

## Features

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection:** Identifies potential XSS vulnerabilities by injecting a test payload into form fields and checking for its reflection in the response.
*   **SQL Injection Detection:** Attempts to detect SQL Injection flaws by injecting common SQL payloads into form fields and analyzing server responses for SQL error messages.
*   **Broken Authentication Simulation:** Simulates brute-force attacks on login forms using common username and password combinations to identify weak authentication mechanisms.
*   **Insecure Deserialization (Conceptual):** Provides a conceptual overview of how insecure deserialization vulnerabilities work and the steps involved in exploiting them, without executing actual attacks.
*   **Security Misconfiguration (Conceptual):** Performs basic checks for common security misconfigurations, such as exposed configuration files, backup files, and directory listings.
*   **Open Port Scanning:** Scans a target IP address for commonly open ports, indicating potential entry points for attackers.
*   **Missing Security Headers Check:** Analyzes HTTP responses for the presence of crucial security headers (e.g., HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options) that help mitigate various web-based attacks.

## How It Works

The simulator uses Python's `requests` library to interact with web applications, `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML content and extracting form details, and the `socket` library for network-level operations like port scanning. Each scanning module is designed to simulate a specific type of vulnerability assessment, providing output that indicates potential findings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
*   `BeautifulSoup4` library (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vulnerability-scanner-simulator.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd vulnerability-scanner-simulator
    ```
3.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

To run the scanner, execute the `vulnerability_scanner_simulator.py` script:

```bash
python vulnerability_scanner_simulator.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter a target URL or IP address and then select the type of vulnerability scan you wish to perform.

## Future Enhancements

*   Integration with vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) for more accurate and up-to-date vulnerability information.
*   Implementation of more advanced scanning techniques for each vulnerability type.
*   Development of a web-based user interface for easier interaction and reporting.
*   Integration with a reporting module to generate comprehensive vulnerability assessment reports.
*   Incorporation of machine learning for anomaly detection and predictive vulnerability analysis, similar to advanced features in commercial tools.
